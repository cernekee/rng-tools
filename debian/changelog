  * Debian build-system updates:
    + Set debian/source/format to '3.0 (quilt)'
    + debian/control: build-depend on autoconf, automake and drop
      autotools-dev since automake will take care of it and we do
      not use them directly anymore
    + debian/rules: remove all autogenerated files in clean target,

rng-tools (2-unofficial-mt.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source:
    + Some README/NEWS cleanup
    + No code changes
  * Upload to unstable (closes: #486688)

    + Fix lintian warning: debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error using the
      suggested -f Makefile test
    + Switch to debhelper V7 mode
    + Use standard debhelper initscripts, lets us get rid of our custom
      postrm and prerm.  Ignore failures to start/stop rng-tools in the
      maintainer scripts, however, otherwise we become a pest if /dev/hwrng
      is missing
    + linda is gone, drop override handling for it in debian/rules
    + install upstream README

    <pere@hungry.com> for the patch (closes: #466917)
  * Fix --trng instead of --hrng in manpage and defaults file
    (closes: #388748)

  * "Last changes for Sarge (I hope)"
  * The following changes warrant an upstream version bump:
  + Backport selected changes from rng-tools--hmh-devo--3.0--patch-80:
    + Upgrade udev and makedev versioned depends to require
      hwrng naming of the hardware random device
    + Attempt to makedev only "hwrng", deprecate all other device
      naming for hw_random and friends (closes: #308248)
  + Backport configure.ac tweaks, and call ./configure correctly

rng-tools (2-unofficial-mt.8-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "WTF are they smoking up there?" release
  * Rework initscript to detect yet another new alias for the
    hw_random.  Now udev rules want to call it hwrng.  I love how
    these things keep changing for no good reason.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Feb 2005 04:25:42 -0200

rng-tools (2-unofficial-mt.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New unofficial version:
    * Support for different input drivers
    * Add new high-performance (several Mbit/s) VIA PadLock TRNG
      user-space driver.  This work was sponsored by mekensleep.com,
      in particular by Loic Dachary.  Mekensleep gave me unlimited
      access to a VIA Nehemiah system that they bought for this purpose,
      and which I am told will be available for the general community
      after the rngd work is stablized.
    * --trng=intel renamed to --trng=intelfwh (because Intel may show up
      with something to compete with VIA's PadLock security engine)
    * --trng=via renamed to --trng=viakernel
  * Add NEWS.Debian file to report user-visible changes in behaviour
  * Minor README.Debian improvements and fixes
  * Detect running kernel version, and work around kernel 2.4 bugs in
    entropy accounting

rng-tools (2-unofficial-mt.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unofficial version

    * rngd: fix macro content output in Argp help text
    * rngd_threads.c, rngd_threads.h: dynamically size buffer structures
    * rngd.h: allow up to 1000 buffers, instead of 10
    * add many assert() calls to root out bugs

rng-tools (2-unofficial-mt.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unofficial version:
    * select() and poll() don't always work with /dev/hwrandom
      Thus, even non-blocking IO is a no-go.  Add SIGALRM functionality
      that is pthread-aware to rngd, and use that to implement --rng-timeout.
    * rngd_linux.c: implement --feed-interval in a portable way
    * better thread-safety when logging messages
  * Better watch file using prdownloads.sf.net as primary source of version
    information

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 31 Oct 2004 12:33:02 -0300

rng-tools (2-unofficial-mt.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unofficial version:
    * Deprecate --timeout, rename it to --feed-interval
    * rngd_linux.c: use select() instead of poll(), so that we do not
      lose track of --feed-interval (non-portable to non-Linux kernels)
    * Document in rngd(8) that --fill-watermark now takes percentage values
      and defaults to 50%
    * Implement --rng-timeout, default 10s, so that we can detect a RNG that
      is silent/disabled

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 2004 09:22:39 -0300

rng-tools (2-unofficial-mt.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    + No real changes, upstream just accepted Debian patches
    + Added Jeff Garzik to copyright notice for rngd
  * New unofficial version
    * Get kernel entropy pool size from /proc, and use that to allow
      the user to specify --fill-watermark in percentage values relative
      to the pool size, as well as in absolute bit size
    * Limit --fill-watermark dynamically to the kernel entropy pool size
      (closes: #274479)
    * Better input validation when processing command line parameters
    * Cosmetic changes to code (signed/unsigned cleanups, plus some
      other code/formatting cleanups)
    * Minor manpage typos and formatting fixes
    * Add myself to copyright notice for rngd, due to the threading code,
      and all the other small features
    * Log PID to syslog
    * Make sure we do have work to do before we leave the sink and FIPS
      thread startup code
    * Sync rngtest "entropy source returned EOF" message to be the same
      as rngd's
  * Add watch file for uscan/DEHS
  * Use automake 1.9 in build
  * Minor updates to debian/copyright
  * Update logcheck.ignore for LOG_PID logging, and force-feed the ignore
    file to violations.ignore.d/ to workaround logcheck braindamage

rng-tools (1.1-unofficial-mt.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unofficial version:
    * Better pidfile locking, fixes race;
    * strerror() is not threadsafe, so don't use it inside threads.
      Use strerror_r() instead;
    * Nicer error message when entropy source signals EOF.

rng-tools (1.1-unofficial-mt.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unofficial version:
    * Clean-up 64-bit support, using the __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS and PRI?64
      macros ugliness.  Thanks to the ia64 autobuilder and the gcc warnings
      for the heads-up ;-)

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Jun 2004 17:08:59 -0300

rng-tools (1.1-unofficial-mt.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New unofficial version:
    * Initialize statistics early in rngd.c
  * Switch to arch: any.  I figure that at least ppc, ia32, ia64 and
    amd64/x86_64 may benefit from this package (although I do not know of a
    TRNG for the PPC).  One could also generate the random numbers elsewhere
    and store them in a (big) file, at which point anything that runs Linux
    would be able to use this package with the TRNG output file
    (closes: #252535);
  * Minor updates to package description, and README.Debian.
  * Urgency medium, to get a bug-free version in testing ASAP

rng-tools (1.1-unofficial-mt-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable, since Jeff Garzik seems to be otherwise
    busy and the upstream merge has halted for some weeks now.
  * Ack bugs fixed by previous uploads to experimental:
    closes: #248548, #239810

rng-tools (1.1-unofficial-mt-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Use simple MAKEDEV calls, and kill all legacy "let's fix the
    device inode" code.  Add intel_rng and i810_rng variations to
    the initscript device search list (closes: #248548)

rng-tools (1.1-unofficial-mt-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Major batch of enhancements from yours thruly.  Not yet merged
    upstream, right now consider this a temporary fork (the merge IS
    ongoing).  Do not bother upstream with bugs against this package.
    The new functionality may change, depending on upstream merge;
    ChangeLog:
     + Use multithreading to increase the available bandwidth, now rngd can
       read, process FIPS tests, and feed the kernel at the same time;
     + Store data on buffers, that can be operated independently by the
       threads.  Default to triple-buffering;
     + Lock memory used as buffers of random data;
     + Add statistics, based on ideas from mtrngd.cpp by Martin Peck
       <coderman@charter.net>;
     + Detect and deal with TRNGs stuck in a failing state, using an
       exponential backoff and eventually giving up and exiting;
     + Revamped manpage extensively;
     + Configure /dev/random, /dev/hwrandom and pidfile location using
       autoconf, to avoid hardcoded defaults;
     + Work on systems using kernel 2.6 (closes: #243319)
  * Add logcheck ignore rules;
  * Update README.Debian to reflect new functionality in the package;
  * Update package description and short description a bit;
  * Use --name and --start-as instead of --exec in initscript;
  * postinst: ignore exit status of initscript on start (closes: #239810)
    (yes, I have changed my mind about the issue).

rng-tools (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source:
    + New rngtest by yours thruly
    + Improved FIPS tests
  * Minor update to README.Debian;
  * Separate recommended options by TRNG type in /etc/default/rng-tools;
  * Fix initscript to properly wait for rngd to exit on stop/restart;
  * Update copyright file;
  * Version dependency on a makedev that knows about intel_rng (since
    hwrandom isn't available yet), and add alternative dependency on udev.
    Remove useless dependency on devfsd.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Apr 2004 11:13:34 -0300

rng-tools (1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove all hand-holding about /dev/hwrandom from initscript.
    Instead, try to detect which device we should be using. Also,
    add an /etc/default/rng-tools, and use it (closes: #235045);
  * Add some helpful hints to README.Debian
  * Change n for the continuous run test to 32, due to AMD's RNG. This
    is still FIPS 140-1 compliant for smaller block RNGs, anyway.  It
    will reduce false positives on Intel's RNG as well;
  * Add --rng-entropy (-H) option;
  * Add note in description about what this package is about.  Add
    explanation about PRNGs and TRNGs in README.Debian (closes: #235752).

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Mar 2004 17:16:28 -0300

rng-tools (1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add ugly hack workaround until MAKEDEV support for hwrandom goes in
    (refer to #234366); This closes: #233656.

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Feb 2004 11:11:51 -0300

rng-tools (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #214926);

  * And some enhancements to the upstream code, from yours thruly:
    + Use new automake and autoconf, and enable AM_MAINTAINER_MODE;
    + Fix rngd to also do the FIPS 140-1 continuous run test;
    + Add pidfile control;
    + Improve manpage;
  * Rename package to rng-tools;
  * Ack NMUs: 
    + closes: #101389;
  * Lots of changes in the packaging, including:
    + Drop partial DevFS support (patches are welcome to implement it
      _properly_).  DevFS users must add the required links or modify the
      initscript themselves (closes: #197506 since it is now irrelevant);
    + Standards-version 3.6.1;
    + Debhelper mode 4;
    + Rewrite README.Debian, and add section about Intel RNGs (contributions
      on other RNGs are welcome);
    + Rewrite copyright file to something that is valid;
    + Update initscript to something more proper for an important system
      service.
