rng-tools (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream source:
    + New rngtest by yours thruly
    + Improved FIPS tests
  * Minor update to README.Debian;
  * Separate recommended options by TRNG type in /etc/default/rng-tools;
  * Fix initscript to properly wait for rngd to exit on stop/restart;
  * Update copyright file.

rng-tools (1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove all hand-holding about /dev/hwrandom from initscript.
    Instead, try to detect which device we should be using. Also,
    add an /etc/default/rng-tools, and use it (closes: #235045);
  * Add some helpful hints to README.Debian
  * Change n for the continuous run test to 32, due to AMD's RNG. This
    is still FIPS 140-1 compliant for smaller block RNGs, anyway.  It
    will reduce false positives on Intel's RNG as well;
  * Add --rng-entropy (-H) option;
  * Add note in description about what this package is about.  Add
    explanation about PRNGs and TRNGs in README.Debian (closes: #235752).

rng-tools (1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add ugly hack workaround until MAKEDEV support for hwrandom goes in
    (refer to #234366); This closes: #233656.

rng-tools (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #214926);
  * New upstream version:
    + Support new hw_random device in new kernels;
  * And some enhancements to the upstream code, from yours thruly:
    + Use new automake and autoconf, and enable AM_MAINTAINER_MODE;
    + Fix rngd to also do the FIPS 140-1 continuous run test;
    + Add pidfile control;
    + Improve manpage;
  * Rename package to rng-tools;
  * Ack NMUs: 
    + closes: #101389;
  * Lots of changes in the packaging, including:
    + Drop partial DevFS support (patches are welcome to implement it
      _properly_).  DevFS users must add the required links or modify the
      initscript themselves (closes: #197506 since it is now irrelevant);
    + Standards-version 3.6.1;
    + Debhelper mode 4;
    + Rewrite README.Debian, and add section about Intel RNGs (contributions
      on other RNGs are welcome);
    + Rewrite copyright file to something that is valid;
    + Update initscript to something more proper for an important system
      service.

intel-rng-tools (0.9.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed manpage. (Closes: #110591, #149904)
  * Remove devfs handling, as it has been breaking. (Closes: #116868)
  * Make appropriate links in /dev for devfs systems. Poor fix but 
    should work fine. (Closes: #113320)

intel-rng-tools (0.9.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dependency to makedev (>= 2.3.1-53) for creating /dev/intel_rng.
  * postinst uses MAKEDEV to create /dev/intel_rng if required. 
    (Closes: #101389)
  * Entry for devfsd symlink, /etc/devfs/symlink.d/intel-rng-tools added,
    which creates a symlink for correct use.

intel-rng-tools (0.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dh_installmodules to register kernel module.
  * Integrate mknod in postinst to create /dev/intel_rng, as MAKEDEV
    doesn't yet support it. Check for /dev/.devfsd in postinst.
  * Depend upon makedev | devfsd.
